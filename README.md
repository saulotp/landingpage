This was my #003 challenge from "dailyUI".

The challenge consists in:

"Landing Page "

Then. . . .

What did I learn?

-Background fullscreen image
-Practice more and more position div's
-Opacity is a problem because this effect affects all components inside the aplicated div. But this "background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);" Can solve our lives.

that's all for now.

Contact me for any suggestions or help me to improve my DEV skills I will love it <3
